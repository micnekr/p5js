A collection of projects I was coding along [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) to learn javascript.

Most of the projects were heavily inspired by [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain), but some of them are original or based loosely on the ideas in the videos.

Some projects are not linked in here and there will be no planned updates in the future.
